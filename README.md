# kaggle-capstone-project
A simple gene variant helper tool built for learning. It validates variant format, retrieves details from a mock BRCA1/TP53 database, and returns a short summary. Includes a small history of recent queries.

# Gene Variant Lookup Tool
This notebook is a small bioinformatics practice project where I built a basic gene-variant lookup tool. It checks whether a variant is written in a valid format, retrieves details from a simple mock database (e.g., BRCA1 and TP53), and returns a short summary. I also added a feature that keeps track of recent queries.

# Features

Validates gene variant format

Fetches information from a mock variant database

Generates a clean text summary

Stores a short history of recent queries

Beginner-friendly code and logic

# Why I Made This peoject

I created this project to understand how gene-variant annotation tools work at a basic level. It helped me practice parsing, summarizing, and structuring variant information in Python.

# How to Run

Download or open the .ipynb file

Run it in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Kaggle

Enter a variant (e.g., BRCA1 c.5266dupC) to test the tool
